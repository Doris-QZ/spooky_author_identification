This project is based on a Kaggle competition, [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification). In this project, I will train machine learning models to identify the author of excerpts from horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, and Mary Shelley. This author identification task involves predicting the author based on their writing style.   

The primary **challenge** of this task lies in the excerpts originating from the same genre(horror stories). In same-genre texts, the thematic content and vocabulary often overlap across authors, making it difficult to distinguish them.   

Given this, my **goal** in this project is not necessarily to achieve super-high accuracy but to explore the extent to which unsupervised models can be applied to author identification. If unsupervised models alone cannot achieve optimal performance, I will investigate how to leverage their strengths in combination with supervised techniques to improve results. My focus will be on exploring unsupervised models and hybrid models (combining unsupervised and supervised techniques), then comparing their performance with purely supervised models.

This project is based on a Kaggle competition, [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification). In this project, I will train machine learning models to identify the author of excerpts from horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, and Mary Shelley. This author identification task involves predicting the author based on their writing style.
